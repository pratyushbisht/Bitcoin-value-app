# bitcoin

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

An app which tells the price of Bitcoin of the currency which user selects from the list of given currencies. In this app there are 3 boxes of Bitcoin, Etherium but they all show value of Bitcoin only. Was not able to implement multiple cryptocurrency values for a currency.
Used CoinApi for Bitcoin value
